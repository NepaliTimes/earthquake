        <h1 id = 'fall1'>11:56 25 April 2015 </h1>
    	<h2 id="Fall">On 15 January 2015 on National Earthquake Safety Day, an Editorial in Nepali Times titled
‘Preparing To Be Prepared’ warned: ‘When (not if) the next earthquake strikes Nepal, don’t
ask what the government can do for you, ask what your community can do for itself.’ <br> <br>
Just over three months later, Kathmandu was struck at 11:56AM on 25 April by a 7.8M
earthquake epicentred in Gorkha. Nearly 9,000 people were killed, tens of thousands
wounded, and entire neighbourhoods were destroyed.

        <h1 id = 'fall2'> The Earthquake From Above </h1>
        <h2 id="Fallb">Puffs, then billows, of dust rose from various parts of the city, within minutes shrouding the whole valley in a brown blanket. The historic town of Bhaktapur, at the eastern edge, looked like it was being swallowed by a sand storm. Kathmandu disappeared.

        <h2 id="Fallc">Gyalbu Tamang had spent the night in Langtang village for a prayer vigil, and was on his
way back to his home in Kyanjin, three hours up the valley. <br> <br>
It started drizzling, and he took shelter at a friend’s place. Just before noon as tea was being
served, the ground shook violently. It was strangely dark, large lumps of snow started
falling like in a blizzard.

        <h1 id = 'fall4'>Bhaktapur 2.0 </h1>
        <h2 id="Falld">Every earthquake, even a minor one, shakes Bhaktapur more severely than other parts
of Kathmandu Valley, and seismologists attribute this to its soil structure. It was no
different in 2015 when a 7.8M earthquake rocked central Nepal. Brown dust from
collapsed buildings blanketed the town like a sand storm. <br> <br>
Even 10 years later, the scars of that disaster are all around, even though most of the
monuments have been rebuilt.

        <h2 id="Falle">At 11:56AM on 25 April 2015, the ancient Newa town of Bungamati on the southern fringes
of Kathmandu Valley suffered more damage than most-- it was completely razed. <br> <br>
Some 700 buildings collapsed and at least seven people were killed. The iconic Bungadyo
temple dedicated to the rain god Machindranath collapsed in the 7.8 magnitude quake.

        <h2 id="Fallf">On the morning of 25 April 2015, as shocked residents of Kathmandu were sifting through
the rubble of collapsed homes and temples, there was thunder in the air. Many thought it
was another earthquake. <br> <br>
A formation of six Indian Air Force MI17 helicopters were flying low over the Lalitpur to
land at the airport. Soon after, the Chinese Air Force dispatched its own MI17s, flying over
the Himalaya.

<br><br>
Gautam Nepal, 56 at the time, realised it was an earthquake. He panicked at the thought of his neighbours' multi-storied buildings toppling on top of his modest one-storey house. He rushed out as the high-rises swayed and groaned.

        <h1 id = 'fall8'> Structural Problems </h1>
        <h2 id="Fallh">In 2023, the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority (NDRRMA) conducted a Structural Integrity Assessment of 29,000 public buildings in 145 municipalities across Nepal. Only 9.4% of them were found to be safe. 
<br><br>
The study deployed remote sensing as well as engineers on the ground to assess the risk, and showed that more than half needed major strengthening, while 12.5% could be retrofitted.

        <h1 id = 'fall9'> Yes, quakes can be forecast </h1>
        <h2 id="Falli">Earthquakes would be less scary if they could be forecast, like the weather. Small quakes would no longer be startling, and there could be early warning of bigger quakes, preventing a greater loss of life.
<br><br>
In seismic zones like Nepal, it is not a question of ‘if’ but ‘when’ an earthquake will strike. And most gadgets that detect earthquakes are either false alarms or come just a few seconds before the violent shaking starts.

        <h2 id="Fallj">It is perhaps only when they become a part of the story they are reporting that journalists realise just what a narrow segment of reality they depict in the coverage of a crisis.
<br><br>
This is especially true when foreign correspondents report on a disaster like the earthquake that hit Nepal on 25 April 2015.
