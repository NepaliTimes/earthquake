        <h1 id = 'fall1'>11:56 25 April 2015 </h1>
    	<h2 id="Fall">On 15 January 2015 on National Earthquake Safety Day, an Editorial in Nepali Times titled
‘Preparing To Be Prepared’ warned: ‘When (not if) the next earthquake strikes Nepal, don’t
ask what the government can do for you, ask what your community can do for itself.’ <br> <br>
Just over three months later, Kathmandu was struck at 11:56AM on 25 April by a 7.8M
earthquake epicentred in Gorkha. Nearly 9,000 people were killed, tens of thousands
wounded, and entire neighbourhoods were destroyed.

        <h2 id="Fallb">On the morning of 25 April 2015, as shocked residents of Kathmandu were sifting through
the rubble of collapsed homes and temples, there was thunder in the air. Many thought it
was another earthquake. <br> <br>
A formation of six Indian Air Force MI17 helicopters were flying low over the Lalitpur to
land at the airport. Soon after, the Chinese Air Force dispatched its own MI17s, flying over
the Himalaya.

        <h2 id="Fallc">Gyalbu Tamang had spent the night in Langtang village for a prayer vigil, and was on his
way back to his home in Kyanjin, three hours up the valley. <br> <br>
It started drizzling, and he took shelter at a friend’s place. Just before noon as tea was being
served, the ground shook violently. It was strangely dark, large lumps of snow started
falling like in a blizzard.

        <h1 id = 'fall4'>Bhaktapur 2.0 </h1>
        <h2 id="Falld">Every earthquake, even a minor one, shakes Bhaktapur more severely than other parts
of Kathmandu Valley, and seismologists attribute this to its soil structure. It was no
different in 2015 when a 7.8M earthquake rocked central Nepal. Brown dust from
collapsed buildings blanketed the town like a sand storm. <br> <br>
Even 10 years later, the scars of that disaster are all around, even though most of the
monuments have been rebuilt.

        <h2 id="Falle">At 11:56AM on 25 April 2015, the ancient Newa town of Bungamati on the southern fringes
of Kathmandu Valley suffered more damage than most-- it was completely razed. <br> <br>
Some 700 buildings collapsed and at least seven people were killed. The iconic Bungadyo
temple dedicated to the rain god Machindranath collapsed in the 7.8 magnitude quake.
